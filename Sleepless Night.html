    <h1>Sleepless Night</h1>
    <p><em>By Prince Haybee</em></p><section class="poem-text">
  <p>Night life!<br>
  Silence swallows the Earth.<br>
  Retiring to my bed, <br>
  My eyes feel reluctant to close.</p>

  <p>Is this progress? <br>
  My mind ponders in filth.<br>
  Rolling round and round, <br>
  My body freezes to roll around.</p>

  <p>Rising uncountable times, <br>
  A Restroom seems cooler than the Rest-rooms. <br>
  Sleeping seems not sleepy but feels Sleepy. <br>
  This is going to be a long night, says the minds with dreams.</p>

  <p>Hoping for a better tomorrow, <br>
  I pray to wake up not...<br>
  in a six feet, below the ground.</p>

  <h2>Poem Synopsis</h2>
  <p><em>Sleepless Night</em> captures the restless agony of a mind burdened by anxiety, uncertainty, and fear of the unknown. The speaker portrays the stillness of the night not as peace but as a haunting reminder of internal struggles. Wrestling with sleeplessness, they long for survival and better days ahead, fearing death’s quiet approach. It is a deeply emotional portrayal of sleepless nights faced by dreamers, worriers, and those caught in life's turmoil.</p>
