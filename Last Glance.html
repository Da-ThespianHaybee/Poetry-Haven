        <h3>Poem</h3>
        <p>Push! Push!!<br>
        She yells, the lady in blue.<br>
        With grunt, she cries,<br>
        The woman on bed.<br><br>

        In pains, she lies,<br>
        With no man to hold her hand.<br>
        Here comes a boy covered in blood,<br>
        With a placenta around his fragile neck.<br><br>

        Congratulations!<br>
        She smiles, the lady in blue.<br>
        With cry, she smiles,<br>
        The woman on bed.<br><br>

        Giving him one last glance,<br>
        She kissed the dust at once.</p>

        <h2>Poem Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Last Glance captures the emotional intensity of childbirth—both the joy of new life and the tragedy of maternal death. The poem presents a mother giving birth alone, with only a nurse (“the lady in blue”) by her side. Despite her struggle and pain, she delivers a baby boy but passes away immediately afterward. Her final act is giving her newborn “one last glance,” a powerful and heartbreaking moment.</p>

        <h3>Themes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life and Death:</strong> The poem poignantly contrasts the beginning of a new life with the end of another, emphasizing the fragile balance between the two.</li>
            <li><strong>Motherhood and Sacrifice:</strong> The woman on the bed symbolizes countless mothers who risk their lives during childbirth.</li>
            <li><strong>Loneliness and Isolation:</strong> The absence of a partner or support system adds to the emotional gravity, showing how some women face this life-altering moment alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Duality:</strong> The nurse and the mother both express conflicting emotions: joy and sorrow, relief and pain, birth and loss.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Structure and Form</h3>
        <p>The poem is written in free verse, without a consistent rhyme scheme, giving it a raw and flowing emotional tone. The line breaks reflect the rhythm of struggle, pain, and ultimately, silence. The use of short, abrupt lines like “Push! Push!!” and “Congratulations!” provides dramatic tension and contrast.</p>

        <h3>Tone and Mood</h3>
        <p><strong>Tone:</strong> Tender, tragic, emotional<br>
        <strong>Mood:</strong> Somber, heart-wrenching, reflective</p>

        <h3>Language and Style</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Imagery:</strong> The poem uses vivid imagery like “a boy covered in blood” and “a placenta around his fragile neck” to evoke the rawness of childbirth.</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The “last glance” symbolizes a final blessing, love, and connection between mother and child.</li>
            <li><strong>Irony:</strong> There is a bittersweet irony in the word “Congratulations!”—a word of joy amidst the pain of death.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rhyme Scheme</h3>
        <p>There is no regular rhyme pattern, which is intentional and fitting for the emotional weight of the subject. The irregular form reflects the chaotic, unpredictable nature of childbirth and death.</p>

        <h3>Societal and Real-World Connection</h3>
        <p>Last Glance mirrors the reality of many maternal deaths, especially in places with limited access to proper healthcare. It serves as a call for better support for women—emotionally, medically, and socially—during childbirth. The poem also highlights gender issues, systemic neglect, and the silent sacrifices of women who die giving life.</p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Last Glance is a deeply emotional and socially conscious poem that honors the strength and sacrifice of mothers. Its minimalist style enhances its emotional impact, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of both sorrow and respect.</p>
