  <h1>The Hopeful Negroes</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Poem</h2>
    <pre>
They walked with dreams in shattered hands,  
Across the fields of broken lands.  
With calloused feet and eyes aglow,  
They bore the weight the world won’t know.  

Their backs were bent from years of toil,  
Yet hearts still burned beneath the soil.  
Though mocked and marred by savage laws,  
They carved their names on freedom’s doors.  

No silver spoon nor crown of gold,  
Just tales of pain too loud to hold.  
But still they sang beneath the moon,  
Of better days that might come soon.  

Hope was their only piece of bread,  
They fed on dreams the prophets said.  
Through lashes, chains, and stolen names,  
They rose — like never-ending flames.
    </pre>

    <h2>Poem Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      “The Hopeful Negroes” is a tribute to the endurance and faith of marginalized individuals who, despite generational oppression and systemic injustice, continued to dream of freedom and dignity. The poem reflects their struggle and resilience, portraying hope not just as an emotion, but as a daily sustenance that kept them alive amid hardship.

    <h2>Literary Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      This poem uses vivid imagery and consistent rhyme (AABB) to capture the spirit of oppressed communities — particularly people of African descent — who, though burdened by history and discrimination, remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice and equality. The allusion to scars ("lashes, chains, and stolen names") grounds the poem in historical realities like slavery and colonization, while metaphors like “flames” and “freedom’s doors” portray their unwavering resilience. The poem bridges past and present, suggesting that although the physical chains may be gone, the emotional and societal weight persists — yet so does hope.
