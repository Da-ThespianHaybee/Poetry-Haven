  <h1>Gov-LOWN-ment</h1>
  <div class="poet">by Abubakar Saadu (Prince Haybee)</div>

  <div class="poem">
Day by Day... life looks scary.  
And time seems in hurry.  
As Adams set out foot with hopes,  
Lucifers flap out blades in scopes.  

Till when... can we await better country to come?  
Adams' bloods and sweat... have been the capital kingdom's 'come.  
Man has to work to live a better life was the saying,  
But does man have to live a better life with an atom paying?  

Gov-LOWN-ment!  
Cracking jokes with the bloody head of a family?  
Undoubtedly, your heads might be next... to be cracked fiercely.
  </div>

  <h2 class="section-title">Poem Synopsis</h2>
  <p>
    *Gov-LOWN-ment* is a fierce critique of leadership failures and the systemic exploitation of the common man. The title itself cleverly plays on the word "government," suggesting both "loan" and "low" to signify economic hardship and manipulation. The poem questions the cost of survival and the price of hope in a society where those in power prey on the dreams of everyday citizens.

  <h2 class="section-title">Literary Appreciation</h2>
  <p>
    This poem uses vivid imagery, allegory, and rhetorical questioning to challenge corrupt political systems. "Adams" symbolizes ordinary citizens; "Lucifers" evoke the evil cloaked in leadership. The line “Adams' bloods and sweat... have been the capital kingdom's 'come” is a metaphor for exploitation—how the elite thrive on the suffering of the masses. The poet's tone is accusatory yet prophetic, ending with a striking warning. The rhyme pattern is mostly AABB, giving rhythm to its message of urgency and despair.
